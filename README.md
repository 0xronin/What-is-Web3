### What is Web2?

The current form of web as we know is now referred to as Web2. Web2 is really simple and thus more and more people are joining Web2 everyday. <br>
However Web2 has some flaws.

- Most of the web2 is run on centralized services managed by companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google etc. These companies have over the years collected enormous amount of user's data without user's explicit consent. This data collection leads to personalized ads and products which makes it easier for these tech giants to earn billions while exploiting the user.
- We see a lot of data breaches happening all across web2 leading to reduced security and privacy for one's personal data. When a user's data gets breached its easy for them to become a victim of identity theft, personal attacks etc.

### What is Web3?

Web3 enhances the web we know today by making it decentralized, distributed, open, trustless and permissionless.

- It is getting built such that everything would happen in a decentralized distributed way giving no central authority access to control the system.
- ‘Open’ as it would be open sourced software built by an open and accessible community of developers and executed in full view of the world.
- ‘Trustless’ in that the network itself allows participants to interact publicly or privately without a trusted third party.
- ‘Permissionless’ in that anyone, both users and suppliers,can participate without authorisation from a governing body.
